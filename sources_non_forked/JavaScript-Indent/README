Summary:
================================================================================
I wrote this basically due to the lack of any good javascript indent plugin out there.  And due to javascripts lax syntactical structure cindent() just wont cut it. 

Web-Indent handles all basic forms of add notes, bugs and multi-line and singe line objects: 
var x = {
     y : {
           z;
     }
}

var y = [
      x,
      y,
      z
]

var z = {x : x, y : y, w: w};

t; // no indent

Handles all basic control structures (with or without leading '{'):
if(x)
      // comment
      y;
z;

Handles inline and nextline control structure block initializers ('{' in the vernacular):
if(x) {
     x;
} 
else 
{
     z; 
}

Handles multi-line function declarations:
var x = function( 
      y, // notice one tab over
      z,
      w) {
      t;
}

Handles multi-line control structure statements:
if( x == y ||
      y == z ||
      z == w) 
{
      t;
}

This indenter is also fully compatible with Mootools and esp. its Class package.  I haven't tested it with any of the other frameworks, but due to their similar syntactical nature, I'm assuming they will work as will.

Included Files:
================================================================================
      ~test.js - A sample js file with various coding patterns.  Set tabstop=6 and shiftwidth=6 and comments should line up correctly.
      ~indent/javascript.vim - The core indenting file
      ~indent/html.vim - An updated version of the pre-packaged html indenter that utilizes javascript.vim (MUST BE LOCATED IN SAME DIRECTORY!!)

PS: I'm also not sure if I'm allowed to repost the html.vim, since I couldn't find a license for it.  I'm pretty sure it was the one packaged with vim by default.  If anyone has any objections, I'll take it down immediately.
